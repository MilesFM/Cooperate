# Cooperate
Cooperate is a WIP game in JavaScript based on the The Prisoner's Dilemma. It is being made mainly for my own enjoyment and anyone else who wants to help. Bare in mind this will take a while due to other commitments.

## Planned features
* Custom AI
* Multiplayer (in the far future) using 
* An itch.io page
* A C++ version (hopefully)

## Libraries
* The game is planned to use sockets.io and express with a node.js server.
* All the client side code will be based on the HTML Canvas API and some others like the Web Audio API. It will not use WebGL as I haven't learn Open GL ES. This means I will not be using any frameworks of libaries for the client side JavaScript code. This may however change if I decide that hard coding a feature is too hard.
* The C++ version will use SFML (if that's made).
